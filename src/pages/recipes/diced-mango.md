2. Cut the Mango roughly in thirds by cutting each side about an inch away from
the center.<br/><br/>Discard the center, or if you're feeling adventurous, cut as much of the Mango
flesh off of the Mango pit as you are able to. Divide these pieces into roughly
quarter-inch by quarter-inch bits.<p><img src="../../img/recipe/diced-mango1.jpg" height="75%" width="75%" alt="Mango roughly cut into thirds"></p>
3. Score quarter-inch by quarter-inch pieces into each half of Mango. Dice the
flesh as far back to the skin as you are able.<p><img src="../../img/recipe/diced-mango2.jpg" height="75%" width="75%" alt="Score marks on a mango half"></p>
